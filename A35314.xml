            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Although the things mentioned in the Parables that were delivered by our Saviour and others in Scripture, were never acted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Letter, yet ſomething like thoſe very things was acted by thoſe very perſons to whom the Parables were spoken, which had it been spoken in plain down-right language, would not have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them half ſo well: for Parables are ſuch clear Glaſſes, as (being held up to men) do repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent both them and their actions in a moſt lively manner, and that ſo fully, as that they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ude, or example to illuſtrate the matter in hand.</hi> Parables do familiarly explain divine truths, repreſenting heavenly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters under earthly reſemblances. <hi>If I have told you earthly things</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John 3.12.</hi> that is earthly reſemblances, or ſimilitudes, repreſenting thoſe heavenly truths, which all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ought to know and practice while they are upon the earth. Parables in Scripture do hold forth the ſame truth under divers ſimilitudes. In one Chapter, <hi>viz. Matth. 13.</hi> We ſee how many Parables Chriſt makes uſe of to ſet out the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb facs="tcp:31415:5"/>of heaven by. It is ſaid <hi>ver. 3.</hi> he ſpake ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things to them in Parables, ſaying, <hi>A ſower went forth to ſow.</hi> And <hi>ver. 24.</hi> Another Parable put he forth unto them, ſaying, <hi>the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which ſowed good ſeed in his field.</hi> And <hi>ver. 33.</hi> Another Parable spake he unto them, ſaying, <hi>The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, which a man took, and ſowed in his field:</hi> divers other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables: of like nature ye have in the ſame Chapter. So that as ſome speak of the <hi>Jews</hi> Manna, it was turned into all manner of ſavoury teſts, according to the ſeveral palats of them that eat it, ſo there is that in heavenly Doctrine, which ſuiteth with all true deſires of happineſs.</p>
            <p>Moreover in Parables, ſimilitudes are fetcht from the ſeveral and uſual employments of all ſorts, to illuſtrate that Doctrine of the Gospel, which belongeth to all ſorts. This every one ſhould heedfully mind; how Chriſt speaks to them in the language of their own Trades and Callings: here each perſon in his own Trade and Occupation may learn ſomething for his Salvation. Here the plough-man may meditate on the Parable of the ſower, when he is ploughing up his ground, and turning up the furrows of the earth, which may put him in mind of plowing up the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>llow-ground
<pb facs="tcp:31415:6"/>of his heart: and when he is breaking up the clods of the earth, he may remember, that Gods calls for a broken and contrite heart: and when he put his hand to the plough, this ſhew him the conſtancy of an holy profeſſion. <hi>No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God,</hi> Luke <hi>9.61.</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man may learn what pains to take with his own heart, ſo preparing it for the true ſeed, the word of life: and when he caſteth in the ſeed in the ſeaſon, he may underſtand his own ſeaſon: and as that which a man ſoweth, is not quickned, unleſs it die, ſo he may learn that the body of man after it dieth, and rotteth in the earth, ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and he that ſeeth not ſo much in the ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reaping his grain, is a fool in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſenſe, <hi>1 Cor. 15.36.</hi> his plowing up the ground may alſo ſhew him the grievouſneſs of afflictions, how the wicked plow upon the backs of the Righteous, and make long their furrows. He that thus meditates at the plough, ſhall alwayes have a Sermon before him, every furrow being a line or ſentence; and every grain of Corn that he ſoweth, a Leſſon whence he may learn ſomething of God.</p>
            <p>Here the Gardiner may receive the Gospel as brought to him in his own language, and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Parable of a certain man that bad a fig-tree
<pb facs="tcp:31415:6"/>planted in his Vineyard, &amp;c. <hi>Luke 13.7, 8.</hi> That is, God, who for our capacity is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a man, ſignifying, that he uſed them not as beaſts and ſlaves, but lovingly and kindly as men do, or ſhould do one to another, drawing them with the cords of a man, and the bands of love, <hi>Hoſ. 11.4. Had a fig-tree planted in his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi>] that is, had a people whom he had choſen to himſelf, and both planted, pruned, and watered, by his word and Sacraments: by the <hi>Vineyard</hi> he may underſtand the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the Land of <hi>Jury,</hi> and by the <hi>fig-tree</hi> the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof. Of God's particular planting this Vine, we read, <hi>Pſal. 80.8, 9.</hi> God brought a Vine out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> caſt out the Heathen, and planted it, prepared room for it, and cauſed it to take deep root, ſo that it filled the Land, the hills were covered with the ſhadow of it, and the boughes thereof were like the goodly Cedaers.

That the Church of God alſo is a Vineyard of red wine, that the Lord doth keep it, and water it every moment, and leſt any hurt is, he will keep it night

               </gap>, when the action is only brought for compariſon, as in the Parable of the unjuſt Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, <hi>Luke 16.6.</hi> that as he made friends of his Maſters money againſt an hard time, ſo ſhould we of the goods lent us by the Lord, by giving alms to the poor, whoſe prayers may help us in the day of tryal.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour was frequent in the uſe of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in his diſcourſe and doctrine, and therein he acommodated his speech to his Auditors. The Jewiſh Nation was much uſed to Parables, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the doctrine of the Prophets of old. So the corruption of the Church is ſet forth by the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a degenerate Vine, <hi>Iſa. 5.</hi> and of a moſt unclean harlot; <hi>Ezek. 16.30, 31.</hi> &amp;c. we read <hi>Ezek. 21.2.—6.</hi> Of a Parable of a Wood to be burnt with fire: then the Prophet is commanded to turn his speech to the men of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to denounce deſtruction to them from <hi>ver. 7. ad. 10.</hi> at length he is commanded to ſigh, and groan, and lament bitterly, even to the pain of his loins: And if they enquire into the cauſe of theſe things, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, becauſe evils are coming, at which every heart ſhall melt away. Now by this kind of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage Chriſt took a courſe to enflame their minds after Gospel myſteries. And albeit divine myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb facs="tcp:31415:8"/>were veiled in the Parables, as barely propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the reprobate world, making them the more inexcuſable, through the juſt judgment of God; yet theſe myſteries were revealed by Parables as clearly expounded to the elect, through the goodneſs of God in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But although Parables do familiarly explain and illuſtrate divine truths, yet they darken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths to ſome, to whom it is not given to know the myſteries of the kingdom of heaven: and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, that therefore he ſpake in Parables to them, becauſe they ſeeing ſaw not, and hearing heard not, nor did they underſtand. A ſingular judgment of God on them for their contumacy and contempt of the Gospel. It is an obſervation of <hi>Oleaſter,</hi> that the holy Prophets (especially to great men) spake moſt in Parables, that ſince the people were ſo ſhy of naked truth, it might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in ſome Guiſe.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, the deſign of our Saviour in laying things under parabolical expreſſions, and as it were out of ſight, was, that his hearers might ſeek out the things hereby intended with more diligence, and find them with more pleaſure; for this way of Illuſtration makes things very delightful and pleaſant, and it is not only a way, whereby the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant may be made to underſtand, but the ſcope of them being once found, it will then appear, that no
<pb facs="tcp:31415:8"/>falſhoods, but real truths are contained in them; becauſe truths, not falſhoods, were not only intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſignifyed by them, and ſo Parables are not only lawful, but commendable, and very grateful to the ingenious Reader or Hearer.</p>
            <p>How then ſhould every one deſire to know the meaning of Scripture-parables? as Chriſt's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples came unto him, ſaying, <hi>Declare unto us the Parable of the Tares of the field,</hi> Matth. <hi>13.36.</hi> that ſo they may come to the clear and ſound knowledge of divine truth. Parables are pleaſant, like a Picture drawn with lively colours. And profitable alſo. <hi>Galeacius Caracciolus,</hi> that noble Marqueſs of <hi>Vico,</hi> was converted by a ſimilitude uſed by <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in a Sermon, ſeconded with private diſcourſe.</p>

            <p>Here you have in this enſuing Treatiſe (which I humbly Dedicate to you) a judicious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, and faithful Application of one of our Saviours Parables: <hi>The Parable of the Great Supper,</hi> to which many Guests were invited. The Author was better known to you than to my ſelf, yet not altogether a ſtranger to me. He was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a word-man, but a work-man; a work-man that needed not to be aſhamed: a pattern of wholſome
<pb facs="tcp:31415:9"/>words in ſound teaching, a pattern of good works in well doing, ſo that a man might read his Sermons written as it were in the lines of his life. He was a light of direction in teaching, and a pattern of perfection (as it were) in his life. His Preaching and his Practice; his Words and his Works a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed together. The Law of God is a Lanthorn, good example bears it; it is ſafe following him that carrys the light. That Miniſter only know how to ſpeak well, that hath learned to do well. Then doth the ſeed of the word bring forth fruit, when the godlineſs of the Preacher doth water it in the breaſt of the Hearer. Thus eraving pardon for this my boldneſs, that the Lord may add to thoſe gifts and bleſſings he hath beſtowed upon you, is the prayer of</p>

                  <p>THeſe words are a Parable delivered by our Saviour, whoſe uſual manner it was to propound Divine Truths under ſuch Figurative repreſentations. Wherefore
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31415:11"/>in the handling of a Parable let us obſerve how the genuine ſence of the ſame may be found out: for the miſ-apprehenſion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables hath ſometimes cauſed ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the holy Scriptures.<note place="margin">Tota difficultas para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolae ex tribus capiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus pendere videtur, ex Radice, Cortice, &amp; fructu. <hi>Salmero de parab.</hi>
                     </note> Now in a Parable there are three conſiderable particulars to be obſerved. 1. The root, or ſcope of a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 2.

And this all along we muſt hold as a Canon in the interpretation of a parable, that there is nothing falſe, abſurd, and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the Parables of our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Now farther, that we may rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning of a Parable according to its true ſcope, we muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther look before upon the occaſion of it,<note place="margin">Ex profabulatione, vel affabulatione, vel ipſa fabula: Sic Graeci loquantur. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> HEnce I obſerve, that it is true Chriſtian practice to ſpiritualize earthly things, <hi>John</hi> 3.12. This may thus appear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such practice is the imitation of Chriſt, which may be ſhewn in ſome particulars of his practice. 1. In his calling fiſhers to be preachers, he ſpiritualized their work by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them fiſhers of men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.18, 19. Then they leſt their other Calling, being call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto this, and ſufficiently gifted for it: let this be obſerved againſt the practice of ſome, who would be accounted preachers, &amp; yet are not gifted, nor called, nor perſwaded to leave off their other Callings. This of fiſhing is an apt Metaphor. The world is the ſea, unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, tumultuous: the Church is the Boat, continually toſſed with waves. The fiſhes are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31415:12"/>men, which devour one another in the ſea. The word of God is the net which takes hold of all ſorts of men. Miniſters are fiſhers, whoſe work is toylſome, yet various and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſome: Sometimes preparing, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times caſting the net, ſometimes drawing it. Some count preaching no labour, or toyl, and ſo raſhly venture upon it, but theſe are like ſome idle companions, that ever and anon go a fiſhing in fair weather for an hour or two: Will ye call ſuch fiſher-men? No: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers are ſuch as make it their work night and day, wet and dry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When our Saviour ſaw one ſick of the Palſy,<note place="margin">Morbus eſt corruptio totius entis.</note> he ſpiritualized his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by conſidering ſin under the notion of ſickneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.2. Sin is the ſickneſs of the ſoul, and pardon the health of it. The fall of our firſt-parents did wound us, and that wound is putrified: from thence is the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of all manner of diſtempers within us: and every ſickneſs may put us in mind of this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When he was at <hi>Jacob</hi>'s well, he ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualized that water by diſcourſing of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life, <hi>John</hi> 4.10. The grace of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a cleanſing, cooling, and quenching nature like water, which runs through ſeveral
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31415:12"/>channels, till it be ſwallowed up in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When his Diſciples prayed him to eat, he ſpiritualized thoſe words by making his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's work his meat, <hi>John</hi> 4.31, 34. He took as much delight in obeying the will of God, as any do in eating their meat when they are hungry.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When there was talking of harveſt, he ſpiritualized it by diſcourſing of the harveſt for converſion of ſouls, <hi>John</hi> 4.35. The har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of the ſeed ſown by the Prophets, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing as ripe fruit in the converſion of ſouls by the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When he and his Diſciples viewed the Temple, he ſpiritualized that ſight by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of the Temple's and the world's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.2. The Temple was ſet on fire by <hi>Titus</hi> his ſouldides, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of man could not quench it. <hi>Titus</hi> would have preſerved the Temple, as one of the worlds wonders. Thus all the world will be in a flame, and irreſiſtibly burnt one day.</p>

When he ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualizeth us, he changeth our natures, turning our ſinful qualities into ſpiritual, pulling down one frame, and ſetting up another, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5.

                  <p>Moreover, though true Chriſtians do ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualize earthly things, yet there be thoſe who are called Chriſtians, that carnalize ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, who conceive of heavenly things with g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What? are thoſe eternal good things in heaven repreſented under eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. Moſt intimate and immediate union with God: Eating and drinking im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys the inmoſt uniting of the body and meat together. The pious ſoul doth fully poſſeſs God in heaven. Here we are (as it were) ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Lord, but there we are preſent with him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6, 8. Not but that now Saints do truly enjoy God, but then more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately and fully: We are now under his influence, dominion, and bleſſing, but then we ſhall always be before his face. Now Saints are (as it were) in the Suburbs of heaven, then they ſhall be in the City: now in the Gallery, then in the Preſence-Chamber. There is great difference between abiding in the Preſence-Chamber of a Prince, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding within his dominion, though under his protection, and related to him as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It denoteth the abundant ſupply of all wants: Eating and drinking implys the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31415:17"/>of neceſſity, the maintaining of life. Here we are at continual reparations: in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven we ſhall not want any thing, there's a full table: our preſent imperfections in our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will then be made up, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9, 10. And all our inabilities in our duties will be happily ſupplyed. Now we have all the parts of the new man, but then we ſhall have the perfect ſtature of the new man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. There is a great difference between the rough draught, and perfect draught of a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: Now we have the lineaments and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but then we ſhall have the moſt exquiſite complexion and favour of the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The full and familiar enjoyment of good company: Eating and drinking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther implys good fellowſhip. There is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good company in heaven, and enough of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23. Then Saints will not be ſtrange one to another, nor ſhy of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as here full oft they are.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Compleat ſatisfaction in the fruition of all contents and delights: Eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is for delight and merriment, as well as for neceſſity. There is feaſting in eating: hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will be a continual feaſt, and yet the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach not cloyed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. Our hungring and thirſting will be turned into ſatisfaction,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31415:18"/>when our ſeeking God will be turn'd into our ſeeing of God.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. To come into the kingdom of grace, ſubject your ſelves to that kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven which God hath erected here upon earth in the diſpenſation of the Goſpel: we may try our ſelves herein by thoſe ſeveral reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, whereby our Saviour ſets forth the nature of this kingdom.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31415:20"/>ſpiritual principle which is called the ſeed of God, makes us like to God, and tends to the full fruition of God in the other world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis like unto <hi>a grain of Muſtard ſeed,</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. 'Tis like unto <hi>one Pearl of great price,</hi> ver. 46. Chriſt alone as held forth in the Goſpel, and bearing ſway within the heart, is more to be prized than all things elſe.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Perform allegiance unto God; yield your ſelves unto him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13. Princes do claim tribute and homage, and the perſons of the ſubjects (as occaſion ſerveth) are to be at their ſervice: may not God do the like?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Expect protection from God, draw nigh to him, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8. Put your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his wings, to live under divine influence. Spirits may have converſe with one another, though at a diſtance: Thus our ſouls may have communion with our father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

                  <p n="1">1. For their obduration: Parables being Riddles to them, he veiled the amiableneſs of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31415:24"/>thoſe truths from the eyes of their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which they profanely neglected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.13, 14, 15.

Though when they perceived the Parable touched themſelves, they thought this judgment hard, and cryed, <hi>God forbid,</hi> Luke 20.16.</p>

The <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> as appeareth by <hi>Xenophon, Plato, Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, Demoſthenes,</hi> who abounded in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: Likewiſe the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as is evident
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31415:25"/>in their Hieroglyphical Learning, brought in by <hi>Mercurius Treſmegiſtus.</hi> They deſcribed a year by a ſnake turning it's tail into it's mouth.<note place="margin">Annus vertitur in ſe. Familiare eſt Syris, &amp; maximè Palaeſtinis ad omnem Sermonem pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolas jungere. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronym.</hi>
                     </note> They deſcribed God by an eye joyned with a ſtaff, ſignifying he was all-ſeeing, and Almighty. They deſcribed a King by a Bee, having honey and a ſting, thereby ſignifying clemency and juſtice, two Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly properties: Mercy and Judgment ſhould meet together upon the Throne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Inſtruction by Parables is a way very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious for man: For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Parables are preſented to the ſenſes, and ſo the ready and plain way to convey a truth to the underſtanding. By that which we are acquainted with, we eaſily receive ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the nature of a ſpiritual truth. Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes teach clearly and plainly, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.3, 4, 'Tis a familiar way whereby knowledge inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates it ſelf into us. Similitudes work ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner upon weak capacities, than ſylogiſms do.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Parables help the Memory. Being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from things obvious to the ſenſes, they make the greater impreſſion upon the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31415:25"/>This appeareth by the help which we have in a local memory.<note place="margin">Species intelligibiles ſenſibilibus ſpeciebus affixae, tenacius ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent memoriae.</note> Several Pearls or Jewels are kept more ſafely when they are hung upon a ſtring. A Parable is as ſuch a ſtring containing many precious truths.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Parables quicken the affections and ſpirits of men. They kindle a deſire after, and delight in knowledge, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.36. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> quickned and rouzed up the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> by a Parable: when <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> uſed this ſtratagem to betray them, deſiring them, that if they would not grant his requeſt in other things, yet that they would grant him this, to give up ſome certain chief ones among them, that did ſo declaim againſt him. That Oratour uſed this Apologue. There was an irreconcilable hatred between the Wolves and the Sheep: the Wolves at length ſent to the ſheepherds, that they were willing to be at peace, upon this condition that they would deliver up into their hands all their Dogs. Upon this Parable the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> were kept from <hi>Philips</hi> circumvention; they apprehended the danger of the motion, and ſo would not entertain it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Parables convince the judgment: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> gave a juſt verdict againſt himſelf, when
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31415:26"/>the caſe was propounded in a Parable, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.5. Parables are heard without prejudice, when down-right expreſſions ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate.</p>

Pearls and Diamonds ſeed the eye: Sacred truths are proper and pleaſing objects to the eyes of our underſtandings. 2. It is compared to <hi>a ſound,</hi> to <hi>the voice of harpers, Rev.</hi> 14.2.

                     <p n="2">2. In the way of <hi>a type</hi> in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time: the Ark which he built, was a figure or type of Chriſt.

                     <p n="3">3. In the way of <hi>a covenant</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. This covenant is diſpenſed in a two-fold manner: firſt ſingly,

Though men are thus generally invited, yet other fallen creatures (as the Angels) they have not ſo much as an invitation: ſo that there is ſomewhat of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing mercy in the very invitation.

                  <p n="2">2. Though men are thus generally invited, yet they are very hardly perſwaded really to cloſe with the invitation. Though many are called, yet few are choſen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.14. Outward priviledges profit not, where the hidden man of the heart is not right: a form without the power of godlineſs is nothing. Many a ſhip hath been called by the name of Safe-guard, Good-ſpeed, and ſuch like ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious names, which yet have been ſplit upon the rocks, or fallen into the ſands.</p>

'Tis dangerous to tempt, reſiſt, or quench the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

Here many are bidden to partake of grace in the Goſpel: elſewhere many are forbidden to partake of glory in heaven; and that for their contempt of Goſpel-grace, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22, 23.

God calls none to any particular calling in Church or State; but he gifteth them for it.

He takes pleaſure in man's converſion and ſalvation, as appeareth by the means he hath provided for man's good, comparing it to things of the greateſt efficacy: calling his word <hi>muſtard ſeed, leaven, aſword, a hammer, fire, &amp;c.</hi> As likewiſe by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal means: The motions of his ſpirit knocking at the doors of mens hearts, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening them in ſome meaſure by convictions, when he goes no further. This appears like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the hatred God expreſſeth againſt man's deſtroying enemy, <hi>Sin:</hi> he is not the Author or Abettor of it, but the great oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But if God take no pleaſure in the deſtruction of a ſinner, why then is he ſaid to laugh at it? <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Resp.</hi> Conſider deſtruction meerly as the ſinner's miſery, ſo 'tis diſpleaſing to God; but conſider it as it is an act of juſtice in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the wicked for his impenitency, ſo it is well-pleaſing to God, for he is juſt as
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:31415:45"/>well as merciful. A juſt Judge may grieve to inflict puniſhment upon a man, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the ſame act as it is the execution of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Here we may ſee that man's ruine is not to be charged upon God's unkindneſs, but upon his own untowardneſs. Man ſince his fall is apt to charge God with the inequality of his ways, when this charge is juſtly laid at mans door, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.29. This quarrel may be eaſily decided, if we conſider theſe things.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Conſider <hi>the intereſt</hi> on both ſides: God could make ſomething of man's bad bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but man could make nothing of it: God can glorifie his juſtice by this means: God need not loſe his glory, though men loſe their ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The carriage</hi> of both parties: God minds man's recovery more than himſelf

Yea 'tis ſaid, <hi>God ſent his own ſon in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.3. Though his fleſh was not ſinful, yet he was juſt like to ſinful fleſh. As to imputation in reſpect of God, who laid upon him the iniquity of us all, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. and as to reputation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of men, he was reputed a ſinner, being reckoned among the tranſgreſſors, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>This may alſo inform us of the exaltation of miniſters, they are ſervants, but, of the Lord: and this title they may glory in, <hi>Jud.</hi> 1. <hi>Jude</hi> might have called himſelf a near Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to Chriſt, or Chriſt's brother, for he was ſo accounted, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.55. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.3. and he was ſo as much as <hi>James,</hi> who is called <hi>the Lord's brother,</hi> Gal. 1.19. but ſurely alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to Chriſt in the ſervice of the Goſpel, is better than alliance to him in the fleſh. To be a faithful miniſter of Chriſt, or true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever on Chriſt, is more honour than to be a natural brother of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Here alſo take notice of the condition of ſervants:<note place="margin">Servi ſunt imo homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, imo contuberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, imo humiles ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci, imo conſervi. <hi>Sen. Epiſt. 47.</hi>
                     </note> though their calling be low in the world, yet 'tis as lawful as any other worldly calling, and very uſeful, elſe Chriſt would never have taken
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:31415:49"/>upon him <hi>the form of a ſervant.</hi> Therefore ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhould be reſpected for their uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Philem. v.</hi> 16. <hi>Seneca</hi> hath a pretty Epiſtle to perſwade his friend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect his ſervants, and not to carry himſelf ſeverely and rigidly, but familiarly towards them. Surely, 'tis your wiſdom, ſo to carry your ſelves towards your ſervants, that they may not only fear you, but love you. And let ſervants be contented in the places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God ſets them: for if Chriſt could, then a Chriſtian may do God and men good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the form of a ſervant.</p>
                  <p>Here alſo you may ſee God's indulgence to man, as to ſend ſo many ſervants for his good, and among the reſt his ſon for one, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.10, 11, 12, 13. Lord! what is man, that thou ſhouldeſt be thus mindful of him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Four things are to be noted by way of Caution.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though Chriſt be God's ſervant, yet he is his <hi>Fellow:</hi> ſo God doth call him. <hi>The man which is my fellow,</hi> Zech. 13.7. not a ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inferiour God, as the <hi>Arrians</hi> would have him, denying him to be true God: God calls him ſo (ſaith one) to ſhew the unity of the eſſence,<note place="margin">Diodat in loc.</note> and unity of the will of the father, and of the ſon, the mediator:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:31415:50"/>Chriſt did account it to be no robbing of his fathers honour to be equal with God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. The ſame he is in nature, and in working, and all are bound to honour the ſon as they honour the father, <hi>John</hi> 5.23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though Chriſt be the ſervant of God, yet he is Lord of the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4, 5. appointing laws to govern it as he pleaſeth. Yea, he is Lord of all creatures, both of the dead and of the living, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. he is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. A name is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him above all names: he is the great God and our Saviour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though miniſters are the ſervants of God, yet they are not the ſervants of men, but only for God's ſake, doing ſervice for the good of ſouls, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. They are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants for the people, not of the people. It is obſerved by the Judicious, that miniſters are called <hi>Miniſters of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.4. <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.1. <hi>miniſters of the new Teſtament,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6. <hi>miniſters of the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Theſ. 3.2. <hi>miniſters of the Lord,</hi> Eph. 6.21. but never miniſters of the people.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though miniſters are ſervants of God, yet they are no ordinary ſervants. They are as ſtewards to a Lord, or Embaſſadours to a Prince, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. Yea they are ſaid to be labourers together with God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9.</p>

                  <p>Here alſo obſerve, that we have one privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge above them who lived before Chriſt came in the fleſh: they had the dawning of

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:31415:59"/>and diligently ſtudyed them afterwards, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great in hearing the word would many times ſtand up all Sermon-while: and when ſome of his Courtiers told him, it tended to his diſparagement, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that it was in the ſervice of the great God, who is no reſpcter of perſons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Be affected with the word you hear. The word preached doth as it were repreſent truth before the eyes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1.

To come to God in Chriſt is the beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment we can give the Goſpel. To come to hear is ſomething; to receive God's meſſengers reſpectfully is ſomething, to be reclaimed from profaneneſs, and to take up a form of Religion is ſomething; but the chief of all is wholly to give up our ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. THis informeth us, that man hath nothing to do toward his own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, but to receive what God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and to walk as he hath received it: the receiving is by faith: a weak faith is a joynt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:31415:66"/>Poſſeſſor, though no faith is a joynt purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of this ſpecial priviledge. The walking as we have received Chriſt, is to expreſs the truth of our faith in the holineſs of our life, with all conſcientiouſneſs as in God's ſight, and exemplarineſs as in mens ſight, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6, 7.</p>
                  <p>Here ſee the difference between God and man, in reference to Goſpel-proviſion. All is ready on God's part, but alas! what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readineſs is there on our part, how indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are we to any thing that is good? Inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as God ſpeaks thus to man, <hi>wilt thou not be made clean, when ſhall it once be?</hi> Jer. 13.27. Men linger in the ſtate of nature, as <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> and did not God pull them out, there they would abide for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. For Caution. Though all things be ſaid to be now ready, we muſt not think, as if all were but now ready: we muſt know, that Chriſt is the Lamb ſlain from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. ſo that Chriſt's bloud in its vertue, and God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation was of force for man's ſalvation in the days before he came perſonally into the world. And as for the foundation of man's happineſs in his election, this was prepared before the foundation of the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.33. Moreover, though all things are ſaid to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:31415:66"/>be now ready, yet there is much to be done before all the elect come to heaven; there are many enemies of Chriſt which muſt be pull'd down, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. and though Chriſt hath done the work of a Prieſt on earth in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up himſelf as a ſacrifice, yet he is ſtill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of the High Prieſt in heaven, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the worth of his ſufferings in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his father, as he did once die for us; ſo he doth ever live for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Be exhorted to anſwer this readineſs of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Be ready to receive this grace of the Goſpel: all things are ready, therefore come, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.4. let thy heart be ready and prepared, remove the filth that is in thy heart: adorn thy heart with gracious quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: attend upon means of grace, there God comes with a bleſſing.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:31415:71"/>reſt of the world. Dr. <hi>Sutton</hi> ſaith, divide the whole world into three parts with <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> or into four with ſome latter writers; or with ſome Geographers into ſix; and you ſhall find one of ſix that profeſs the true God. Thoſe that do, are driven into a narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the North-weſt: and in that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny take out Atheiſts, Papiſts, Newtrals, Worldlings, and Hypocrites; the remainder will be very ſmall; nothing to the others.</p>
                  <p>Here alſo ſee, that multitude is no true note of a Church, as the Papiſts ſay. The Church was once contained in the family of <hi>Seth, Gen.</hi> 6.2. afterwards in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Since Chriſt's coming, how hath it been crowded through the defection under Antichriſt's reign into a ſmall compaſs. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaith, we muſt not number, but ponder the men, to find out the true note of a true Church.

                     <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to moleſt, when they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Deut. 2.4, 5, 9. They combine here againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to caſt them out of God's inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, ſo ill did they reward them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though they differ <hi>in Religion,</hi> yet they agree to oppoſe the Goſpel. Thus the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and the <hi>Jews:</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> worſhipt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gods, the <hi>Jews</hi> but one God, and that the true God, yet both theſe people combined againſt Chriſt, and put him to death. <hi>The Gentiles and people of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Act. 4.27. though they agreed not in the profeſſion of Religion, yet they agreed in the perſecution of Religion, and that with extremity of malice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though they differ in opinion, yet they agree to oppoſe them, that hold to the truth of the Goſpel. The Councel before which St. <hi>Paul</hi> was brought in defence of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, one part was <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and the other part was <hi>Sadducees,</hi> Act. 23.6.

                  <p n="4">4. Though they differ <hi>in affection,</hi> yet they agree in diſ-affection to Chriſt. <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> were made friends in putting Chriſt to death, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.12. 'Tis ordinary to ſee ſome great Perſons that envy one another,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:31415:74"/>to be as one in oppoſing good men.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though they differ <hi>in factions</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet they can agree together againſt the godly party; as the <hi>Herodians</hi> and the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> againſt Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 12.13.

                     </gap>, ſignifies to make an exact tryal. A metaphor taken from ſearching, or trying metals, or from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of men, which examine thoſe that ſtand for an office. Thus this Farmer in the Text was very exact to prove, or try his Oxen, to ſee whether they would bear the yoke, and draw. Here obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That men are very careful and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to prove what they have of the things of this world, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1.13.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. This appeareth by the ſeveral things that men do prove.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:31415:107"/>1. To begin with that in the Text, the Cattel which men uſe. If a man buy a yoke of Oxen, he proves them, to ſee whether they be for his turn: if he buy an horſe, he will prove it to ſee how it goes, or draws.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Land which men occupy. If men buy a field, they will view it, to ſee the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ground, how good it is. If any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie ariſe, they will meaſure it, to ſee how much there is of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Money that men buy Land or Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel with, they will try it. Hence we read of Gold tryed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. men prove metals by the fire, to ſeparate, and conſume the droſs: by the touch-ſtone, to diſcern good metal from counterfeit: by the ſcales, to ſee whether it be full weight.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Men will try their food. Their Wheat is meaſured, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.6. and the bread that is made of it is weighed. Phyſick alſo is tryed, a <hi>probatum eſt</hi> doth well at the end of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The cloath you wear is tryed; and your leather is ſealed in the Market.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The very High-ways you travel in, you will have Officers appointed to be Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. This alſo appeareth by the courſe men take to prove what they have.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:31415:108"/>1. By laviſhing away much precious time, riſing up early, ſitting up late in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after theſe things. Time is precious, and looks at eternity, and 'tis great pity it ſhould be ſquandered away about trifles, but how apt are men ſo to do?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By commencing coſtly Suits at Law, to try the title of what they have. Men by their quarrelſome contending thus one with another, ſhew the weakneſs of their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſtrength of their paſſions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.6, 7. methinks it were mens wiſeſt courſe to try that firſt, which uſually they come to at laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> a Reference: of thoſe that go to Law, we may ſay as <hi>Charondas</hi> once did of thoſe that go to Sea: though he wondred not at thoſe that went once, yet he did at thoſe who went again.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That they may know what they have: men care not to be at uncertainties about theſe worldly vanities; they love to know what is their own: though the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be but of an uncertain and periſhing nature, yet men love to be at ſome certainty about them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they may uſe what they have. Wherefore is any thing but for ſome uſe or other? therefore money is ſaid to anſwer all things,<note place="margin">Quò mihi divitia, ſi non conceditur uti?</note> becauſe with it men may have wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to ſupply any of their outward wants, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.19. money may be turn'd into any thing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That they may delight in what they have: rejoyce and be merry in what they do enjoy, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.12. it is well, when good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry and good content can dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That they may hold what they have. Men are apt to gripe hard, and claſp cloſe the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:31415:109"/>things of this world, and that they may have the faſter hold, they make the ſurer tryal.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That they may the better diſpoſe of what they have: when men can hold their goods no longer in their own hands, yet then they would have it in no other hands but by their appointment. Their ſubſtance they leave to their Relations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14. and their will ſtands in force when they are gone: and their heirs are careful to prove the will, to make all therein contained more ſure unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

                  <p>Here the Saints practice is juſtified in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, from the worldlings practice
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:31415:109"/>in earthly things.

                  <p>Here alſo ye may ſee, that the world doth choak the word, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.7. it hindereth the growth of it, ſo that the love of the world is not ſeated in the heart, neither doth the fruit of it appear in the life: hence it is, that many

A word frequently made uſe of by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane writers in that language. Poets, Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Hiſtorians, Moraliſts: and by ſome in this ſenſe to make report as Embaſſadours do when they return from their embaſſage. So that great Moraliſt makes uſe of the word, which ſenſe ſuits well with our Text. <hi>His Lord]</hi> that is, he who made the feaſt, and ſent him as a meſſenger to invite. <hi>Theſe things,]</hi>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:31415:128"/>that is, the very naked truth of thoſe ſeveral excuſes, as they were given in by the Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Gueſts, without any excuſing of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> That the meſſengers of the Goſpel do relate unto God thoſe anſwers which are made by the refuſers of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>The anſwers made by the refuſers of the Goſpel we heard before in the examination of their ſeveral excuſes: now let us ſee how the meſſengers do relate, or ſhew theſe things unto their Lord.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By producing the commiſſion they had to ſpeak in God's name: they ſhew unto their Lord the diſpatching of their errand accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his mind. He that had the five talents, ſaid, Lord, thou deliveredſt to me five talents, and behold, thus and thus I have made uſe of them. And ſo he that had the two, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.20, 22. Lord, ſaith the preacher, Thou didſt put me into ſuch an office. Thou didſt endue me with ſuch gifts, and I did exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that office, and employ thoſe gifts among ſuch a people, I wholly gave up my ſelf to the work.</p>
                  <p>Here be thoſe I ſpake among, let them deny it, if they can.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By declaring what, and how they ſpake by vertue of that commiſſion. They ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:31415:128"/>their Lord the Scripture they preached, the Texts they handled, the Argumens they uſed, the affection they expreſſed in the diſcharge of their duty in the work of the miniſtery, <hi>John</hi> 17.14. &amp; 15.22. Lord, ſaith the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, I gave them thy word to whom thou didſt ſend me: and though ſome did receive it, yet others did refuſe it, and hated thoſe who did receive it. Thy word I taught without mixture and deceit, preſſing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of thy ſacred majeſty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By complaining of the obſtinacy of thoſe who hear the word. <hi>Lord, who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved our report?</hi> Iſa. 53.1. Lord, how few are there that regard what we ſpeak? They look upon thy word as our report, as though it had no other Author than our ſelves, and ſo give no heed or credit to what we ſay. They conſider not that thou ſpeakeſt when we ſpeak, and ſo they think they are not bound to believe us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By reporting the ill uſage they meet withall from the oppoſers of the Goſpel. They ſhew their Lord what they ſuffer for his names ſake. The Apoſtles returning from their Adverſaries to God, ſaid, <hi>And now Lord, behold their threatnings,</hi> Act. 4.29. Lord, ſaith the preacher, behold how many ſpeak againſt us, becauſe we ſpeak for thee,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:31415:129"/>how many threaten us, becauſe we denounce thy threatnings againſt them for their ſins. We may be ſure that God hearkens to ſuch grievances.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By appealling to God as the ſupream power, whoſe name hath the greateſt wrong by the oppoſers of the Goſpel, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.24, 25. They ſhew unto their Lord, that the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of enemies is not ſo much againſt them [poor ſervants] as againſt himſelf, and Son and heir Chriſt Jeſus. In outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it is againſt us, but of a truth it is againſt thy holy child Jeſus.</p>

In the life to come, when they appear to give up their account at God's tribunal: then they ſhall lay all open, and ſpeak plainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all that opoſed the truth. Like as the the Prophets ſometimes prophetically deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abſolutely, that the curſe of God might fall upon ſuch enemies of theirs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.20, 23. which kind of imprecations, though God's meſſengers muſt not now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, yet ſurely hereafter they will.

                     </note> why mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are ſo much deſpiſed by many, it is becauſe their employment is to diſcover the faults of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that diſpleaſeth thoſe that are faulty, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.28. not only the profane, but the erroneous too, do fall out with ſound and faithful teachers.

The preachers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice diſpleaſeth thoſe that allow themſelves in any ſin, and ſo conſequentially it cannot be but their perſons are oppoſed.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is but a folly, for any to think to fare the better for their acquaintance with the meſſengers of the Goſpel, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the meſſage of the Goſpel, for they muſt relate things as they are. <hi>'Tis required in ſtewards, that a man be ſound faithful,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.2. Though the hearer ſhould be Wife, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Siſter to the preacher, and ſhould live contrary to the Doctrine of holineſs which he preacheth, yet none of them ſhall
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:31415:131"/>be advantaged by their relation to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Yet 'tis not the meſſenger of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Malitia tua te ad mortem adduxit, non nos. <hi>Lyran.</hi>
                     </note> but the refuſal of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-meſſage that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth men: it is mens own ſin that caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them.

                  <p>Now though God's meſſengers make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to God, yet it is not to inform him, as though he did not know thoſe things without that report: God is greater than our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, yea than our hearts, and knows all things, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.20. all things are naked and open in his ſight, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12.</p>

Muſt Miniſters ſhew to the Lord what you do; oh then take heed what ye do! Venture not upon any known ſin upon any pretence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.10. Think with your ſelf, would you do ſuch a thing, if the

Ye that will go on in the ways of your own heart, know ye, that for all theſe things God will bring you to judgment, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.9.</p>
                  <p>If it be thus, then conſider, what anſwer will ye now give to the meſſenger of the Goſpel to be returned in your behalf.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let it not be <hi>a refractory anſwer,</hi> like that of the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>Jeremiah, We will not walk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> Jer. 6.16. oh let not your hearts riſe, and ſwell againſt the holy word of God.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Though God here be ſaid to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, yet muſt we not think God to be like to out ſelves, as though he were ſubject to, or capable of paſſions as we are. Fury is not in him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.4. God is without parts and paſſions, he is not carryed by affections. They are neither materially, nor formally in God, whoſe eſſence is unmixt, and immutable: In man anger is a mixt affection, made up of theſe two ingredients, <hi>Sorrow,</hi> and <hi>Revenge.</hi> Man is diſturbed when angry. <hi>Scylla</hi> in an exceſs of fury vomited up bloud, and dyed: but God is not diſturbed in his anger. Anger in God is a work contrary to his diſpoſition of himſelf, who inclineth rather to mercy. If men would lay down their ſins, God would lay down his anger for ever, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Take heed of an evil heart of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, for this makes God ſo angry, as to ſwear in his wrath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.11, 12. <hi>Will ye provoke the Lord to jealouſie? are ye ſtronger than he?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 10.22. Gods anger is compared in Scripture to a whirlwind, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.27. which comes ſuddenly, and irreſiſtibly, and with a terrible noiſe, renting and tearing where it cometh. It is compared to an over-flowing floud,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:31415:135"/>
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.2. which no banks, nor bounds can keep in. It is likened to a devouring fire: hence is that phraſe of his anger being kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and waxing hot, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.24, 25. and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are compared to dry wood. If theſe things be done to the green tree, what ſhall be done to the dry? it is alſo compared to the raging of a Bear bereaved of her whelps, and to a Lyon and Leopard. All are put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.7, 8. This anger of God put the fallen Angels into everlaſting chains, <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 6. It drove man out of Paradiſe, turning him out unto the wide world as it were to ſhift for himſelf. Spoiling him of all his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and endowments. It drowned the old world, and turned <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> into aſhes. It ruined the <hi>Jews</hi> both as a Church and a common-wealth. Let all that have felt the anger of God, ſpeak whether it be not an intollerable burden. Oh kiſs the ſon, leſt he be angry, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. both with a kiſs of faith, and of love and affection to him: take his yoke, ſubmit to his government. If Chriſt be angry with you, you periſh in the way. Thoſe that refuſe Goſpel-light, ſhall be caſt into outer-darkneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.12. But bleſſed are they that truſt in him. They who thus come to him, ſhall be welcome: they ſhall have the ſmiles of his face, the kiſſes of

                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12. This was in the night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retired from worldly buſineſs, that God
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:31415:136"/>revealed his mind by dreams. Theſe Divine dreams were ſent upon weighty occaſions, and they left a certain perſwaſion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe of God's preſence upon the ſoul, ſaith <hi>Muſculus.</hi>
                        </item>

A ſpecial priviledge that <hi>Moſes</hi> had above the reſt of the Prophets.

                        <item>3. By <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim:</hi>

                        <item>4. By Viſions. Thus God revealed the knowledge of Chriſt as a mighty one, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:31415:137"/>This was in the day, as dreams in the night. In theſe viſions there was. 1. The repreſenting of ſpiritual things by ſenſible forms. Hence God is ſaid to multiply viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and to uſe ſimilitudes by the miniſtery of his Prophets, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.10. A plain diſcovery of deep myſteries. Thus the King of <hi>Babylons</hi> coming againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was repreſented by a great Eagle, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.3, 12. a fit Emblem, as appears by the collation which the Prophet makes. As theſe predictions were called vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſo the Prophets were called <hi>Seers,</hi> and they were Hieroglyphical Teachers, giving inſtructions by Emblems. 2. There was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the irradiation, or ſhining light on the minds of the Prophets, whereby there was the certain knowledge of thoſe divine truths im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to them. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaith, the heavens were opened, and he ſaw the viſions of God. The opening of the heaven, and the opening of the underſtanding do make an undeniable demonſtration of the point, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.1. There was alſo. 3. The impulſe of the ſpirit, whereby they were ſtrongly carryed to make known that to others, which God made known to them. Hence the word of the Lord, and the Hand of the Lord, are joyned together, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.3. The word of the Lord came expreſly to him with that evidence and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:31415:137"/>clearneſs, that he could not withſtand it: and the hand of the Lord was upon him. The ſpirit of the Lord took hold of him, and made him carry that word unto the people.</item>
                        <item>5. By inſpiration, infallibly to ſet down in writing the mind of God. Thus in old time holy men ſpake, as they were moved, or <gap reason="foreign">

In ſpeaking of which, the Pen-men of Scripture often ſpake againſt themſelves; they minded not their own perſonal credit or diſcredit as other writers do.</item>

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. THis ſhews us, that the preaching of the word is to be delivered as the Oracles of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. not raſhly, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:31415:138"/>waveringly, but reverently, and reſolvedly. The Prophets of old durſt not give out any thing to the Church, but what God firſt gave out to them, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.1. So what is now ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, muſt be fetched from the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. Away then with their practice, who thruſt the decrees of men upon people for the ordinances of God.</p>
                  <p>Then muſt not the preachers of the word ſeek to pleaſe men, for if they ſhould, they ſhould not be the ſervants of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10. every ſervant muſt ſtudy to pleaſe his own maſter: Miniſters muſt not ſtudy to gratifie the humours of their hearers: nor muſt they claw the itching ears of humorous ones. Thoſe that do ſo, are not God's builders, but the Devil's dirt-daubers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Yet this doth not make, but that preachers may conſult with humane Authors. <hi>Paul</hi> cites the ſaying of an Heathen Poet, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.12. Though humane Learning be not ſo requiſite for the delivery of the plain truths of the Goſpel, yet it is very material for the confuting the ſubtil cavils of the oppoſers of the Goſpel. Yea preachers may receive light from men like themſelves; not only from the Scriptures, but from judicious expoſitors. Though no writings may be received in a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination with the holy Scriptures, yet they
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:31415:139"/>may in a ſubordination to them. Though the Scripture explain it ſelf, yet 'tis but a Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal expoſitor, and we have need of perſonal expoſitors too, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.31. The Mathematicks are not learned without a Teacher, ſo it is with many Scriptures which are hard to be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Doth God ſpeak to his meſſengers what they ſpeak, then let our behaviour be anſwerable to the belief of ſuch truth.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. In reference to the Scriptures where God ſpeaks, let us look upon them as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. Oh what majeſty and harmony, what verity and purity is in them! Read the Scriptures, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate therin, as the word of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. They are as a Letter ſent from Chriſt to a particular perſon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1. let them much affect thee in the reading theſe lines. They are as good news out of a far Country, oh welcome it. They are as a Statute-book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thoſe wholſome Laws according to which we are to order our lives: it concerns us to be well skilled in them.</item>
                     <item>2. In reference to Chriſt, that meſſenger of the Covenant, by whom God doth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally ſpeak unto men: let us hear him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God ſends to us by him, and hath in a ſpecial manner authorized him to ſpeak unto
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:31415:139"/>us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.5. yield faith and obedience to what he ſpeaks, <hi>hear and live,</hi> Iſa. 55.3.</item>
                     <item>3. In reference to Miniſters: Account of them as the miniſters of Chriſt, and ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of the myſteries of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. wait on the miniſtry of the word, as upon God himſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.34. do not expect that God ſhould teach you without the means, if ye neglect the means he hath ſet up among you. Frequent the publick miniſtry: be attentive hearers. It is dangerous to fall aſleep with a Candle burning by your ſide, ſome have been ſo burnt in their beds: but it is more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſleep, while the Candle of the word is burning ſo near you: and do not wander in your thoughts, that is, to ſleep with your eyes open. Be alſo retentive hearers: food re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, if it ſtay not with us, doth us no good. The honeſt and good heart having heard the word, keeps it, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.15. If you have not ſtrength of memory to keep the words of a Sermon, ſee that ye have an honeſt heart to keep the ſubſtance of a Sermon. I have heard of a woman, having (methinks) ſuch an heart, who coming from a Sermon, one askt her, what ſhe remembred, ſhe anſwered, that at preſent ſhe could not recal much, but ſhe heard that which ſhould make her to reform ſome things as ſoon as ſhe came home.</item>

                  <p>See here alſo how unbeſeeming ſloth and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs is in the Miniſters of the Goſpel. A lazy labourer; an idle Miniſter is as abſurd as a blind eye. God cannot bear with ſuch. <hi>Oh thou wicked and ſlothful ſervant!</hi> Matth. 25.26. Such a loyterer is an unfaithful Steward in God's houſe, who wraps up his talent in idleneſs, and burys it in the earth, where perhaps he is playing the worldling all his time.</p>

Though the meſſengers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are to go quickly when they are ſent, yet they are not to run before they are ſent. We read of a ſcribe inſtructed unto the kingdom of heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.52. it is not for every one who can ſpeak an hour to adventure upon the work of reaching.</p>
                  <p>Again, though Miniſters ſent are to go quickly, yet they muſt not in their ſpeaking
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:31415:143"/>be too quick for their hearers: they ſhould make no more haſt than good ſpeed.

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Muſt miniſters go quickly to you, then anſwer this Doctrine with the quickneſs of your motion! be ſwift to hear: Make uſe of all opportunities where ye may hear ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the good of your ſouls. Be you as quick in cloſing with the Goſpel, as God would have his meſſengers quick in diſcloſing it. Make your peace with God ſpeedily, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.25. The only way for this is through Chriſt, that one mediatour between God and man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. If you would not hazard the loſs of all by continuance in ſin, make haſte to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound through faith in Chriſt. Be ſure ye do not put off Goſpel-advice a day longer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7. Chriſt bid <hi>Zacheus,</hi> make haſte, and come down, and accordingly he did, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him joyfully, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.5, 6. Be reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in your ſpirits till you find Chriſt, who is the reſt of your ſouls. Enquire diligently, whether you are in the way to heaven, then make haſte in that way, go on with ſpeed. The life of Chriſtianity is as a race, therefore ſo
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:31415:143"/>run that ye may obtain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24. Sin is like a ſore, the longer you let it alone, the more it feſters and ranckles, and the worſe it is to heal. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>To day, leſt any be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin,</hi> Heb. 3.13. ſin encroacheth upon the ſoul by degrees, <hi>James</hi> 1.14, 15. let young men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member God in their youth: the ſooner any receive the Goſpel-meſſage, they are in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to do God the more ſervice. Do not put off the doing, or receiving good till old age. Yet let not this diſcourage old people from minding good: Better late than never. If you come in (though at the eleventh hour) you ſhall have your reward, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.9. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was old when God called him.

                  <p n="1">1. Not <hi>civil defects,</hi> as want of worldly wealth. The pooreſt need not ſcruple co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, thoſe that have no money may come and welome, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. the Goſpel-proviſion is not an ordinary, where ye pay for what ye have, but as a Feaſt, whereto ye are freely invited, and whereat you may fully feed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not <hi>corporal defects,</hi> as want of limbs. The maimed, the lame, and the blind, need
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:31415:154"/>not ſcruple coming. The man ſick of the Palſie was healed both in his body and ſoul, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.25.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Not <hi>mental defects;</hi> as want of wit: though you cannot ſo fully expreſs your mind before God as others, yet fall down before him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Not <hi>moral defects,</hi> as want of good manners, not leading a well-ordered life. The lewdeſt perſons need not ſcruple co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. Publicans, Sinners, Extortioners, Harlots, are received by Chriſt when they come unto him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31, 32. it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the moſt notorious ſinners to believe; and great ſinners have become notable Saints.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here ye may ſee, that God in his chuſing is different from Satan, and from men in their chuſing: Satan makes choice of the craftieſt Heads, and ſubtilleſt inſtruments to carry on his deſigns, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. he picks out a <hi>Goliah</hi> for ſtrength, an <hi>Achitophel</hi> for policy to do his work. And no wonder! for he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make men fit for his turn, when he doth not find them ſo: he cannot put new abilities into men, though he doth excite thoſe abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are in them. Therefore he chuſeth men fit for his turn, ſeeing he cannot make them fit. So men in their ſeveral choices,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:31415:155"/>they avoid defects as near as they can.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Yet all that God chuſeth, are not obſcure perſons: God chuſeth ſome to grace and glory, that are very eminent in the world. <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithful; <hi>Iſaac</hi> the heir of the Promiſe: <hi>Jacob</hi> the man powerful with God, were all very rich. The elect Lady, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>honourable women, and men not a few believed,</hi> Act. 17.12. So God chuſeth ſome to be eminent in piety, who are eminent in natural parts, and moral accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments. Such a one was St. <hi>Paul,</hi> of whom <hi>Porphyry,</hi> that great enemy to Chriſtianity, ſaid, it was pity ſuch a man as <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be caſt away upon the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p>Now as God doth not make choice of none but mean perſons, ſo neither doth he make choice of all that are mean. Many are defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their minds as well as in their bodies, ſuch as <hi>Thyrſues</hi> in <hi>Homer.</hi> Do we not ſee many poor people live and die in groſs igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and wickedneſs? <hi>David</hi> ſaith, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects gathered themſelves againſt him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.15. ſawcy duſt, (as one calls them) who will be flying in the faces of God's people. And the rage of ſuch many times proves the more furious for want of an ingenious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and civil education.</p>

Doth God make choice of mean perſons, then hearken unto this, ye that are mean in the world and not good, this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine tells you of a way, whereby your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wants may be ſupplyed with ſpiritual abundance: You that are deformed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit, look into the glaſs of God's word, and dreſs your ſouls by that glaſs. As you ſhould labour to ſupply your outward wants with ſpiritual excellencies, ſo you ſhould labour to ſee your ſpiritual wants by your outward wants.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ye that are poor and godly; that are decrepit and deformed in your body, and yet adorned with the graces of God's ſpirit in your ſouls, learn to ſpiritualize your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wants: though the world neither know you, nor regard you, yet you are both known and eſteemed of by the Lord: and though you poſſeſs little or nothing of the world, yet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing God, you poſſeſs all things. Bleſs God for giving you ſpirituals, though he hath denyed you temporals: ye may rejoyce in the God of all mercies, when you have not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward mercies to rejoyce in, <hi>Habak.</hi> 3.17, 18. Expect a change for the better, death will perfect the ſouls of Saints: after death the ſpirits of juſt men are made perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. The Reſurrection will perfect the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:31415:156"/>bodies of Saints: the weak body is raiſed in power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.43. the crooked body will be raiſed ſtreight: the maimed body will be raiſed whole; the Reſurrection will cure all infirmities: the thought of which comforted the Martyrs, when they gave their bodies to be burnt to aſhes. At <hi>Stratford-bow</hi> in Queen <hi>Maryes</hi> dayes were burnt at one ſtake, a lame man, and a blind man. The lame man after he was chained, bid the bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nd man be of good comfort, for they ſhould both be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Ye that are not mean in the world, do not ye deſpiſe whom God makes choice of, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5, 6. <hi>He that despiſeth the poor, deſpiſeth his Maker,</hi> Prov. 17.5. he contemneth the wiſe diſpenſation of God, who would have the world conſiſt of hills and valleys, of high and low people intermingled. And he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth the godly. Poor, defaceth the image of God twice, deſpiſing the immateriality and immortality of God upon the man, and deſpiſing the holineſs and Righteouſneſs of God ſtampt upon the new man.</p>
                  <p>Let both high and low conſider, that theſe outward degrees are only calculated for this world; the Grave takes away all civil dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, <hi>Job</hi> 3.19.

THis ſhews us, what an unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing it is for any to be angry with the meſſengers of the Goſpel, for decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what God commandeth them. Some are angry, when the word of God by us his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers comes cloſe to them, ſtriking at their beloved ſins. Alas we cannot help it, we are but ſervants, and upon pain of our Maſters diſpleaſure muſt do what he commandeth us, deliver his meſſage, be it pleaſing or diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
                  <p>This alſo informs us, that God ſets his ſeal to the miniſtry of the Goſpel. The work of converſion is effectually done according to his command: he owneth the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:31415:160"/>according to the command of God. It is a Rule in Divinity, that active verbs are given to thoſe things which do not properly, and by an immediate influx effect that which the verbs do ſignifie, but do concur to the ſame. God ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> lift up thy rod, ſtretch out thine hand over the Sea, and divide it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.16. Had <hi>Moſes</hi> power to divide the ſea? No, but becauſe there was a certain concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Moſes,</hi> uſing the rod according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, therefore that is attributed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was the work of God alone.

The ſecond is imperfect, but yet ſincere, as the Saints on earth do. The third is external on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unſound, as the hypocrites on earth do. In the firſt ſenſe it is impoſſible for us in this life to keep the commandments; yet this impoſſibility is not by reaſon of the Laws ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidneſs,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:31415:160"/>but by reaſon of our corruption. In the third ſenſe, it is ſinful keeping the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, when we reſt in externals. But in the ſecond ſenſe, it is poſſible, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to keep the commandments. It is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible upon this double account, the will being accepted for the deed, and the failings in all our duties being pardoned through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore anſwer this Doctrine by your ſincere obedience, that ye may be able to ſay, <hi>Lord, it is done as thou haſt commanded.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not only what God hath commanded, but do it as God hath commanded it: So do the work of grace, that the fruits of the ſame may appear continually to be done by you, ſee that your obedience be according to the full latitude of God's Law, whoſe law is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad.</p>

Since that time many more have been brought in.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God brought in many eminent perſons in the old Teſtament, for this very end, that they might be inſtrumental to bring in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. God ſaith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> I know him, that he will command his children, and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. and he had an eminent Son for Religion, <hi>viz.

                  <p n="3">3. Multitudes have been brought in toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the ſame time, and the ſame place: about three thouſand in one day at St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. and the Lord added dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved, <hi>ver.</hi> 47.

                  <p n="5">5. In the darkeſt times both in the old and new Teſtaments, when very few appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there were thouſands that kept cloſe to the true God.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:31415:164"/>no wonder they find no room or place in heaven when they die, who find no place for faith, or repentance, or other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whiles they live. The coming ſhort of Chriſt and holineſs, makes men fall ſhort of heaven and happineſs.</p>
                  <p>This alſo informs us, that there is more room than company, more proviſion than gueſts at the Goſpel-feaſt. <hi>There is bread e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and to spare,</hi> Luke 15.17. it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a fountain, out of which there is more water runs waſte than is made uſe of.</p>
                  <p>Though Goſpel-grace be full and free, and all men need it, yet many there be that make no account of it; they are wholly enſlaved to their ſenſe, and taken up with lower things: heavenly things ſeem to be too far diſtant, to work upon their affections; they ſee the world, but they ſee not God, nor Chriſt, nor their ſouls, nor everlaſting glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>

Thoſe that knock after the door is made faſt, muſt go away as they came, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.25. thoſe that ſtay ſo late till the bridg be drawn up, cannot get over the water. Chriſt is now as

                  <p>Secondly, though there be room in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Chriſt is gone to prepare a place for us, yet we muſt not conceive of heaven as an houſe like ours, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. conſiſting of many rooms, and thoſe not yet furniſhed or finiſhed; but the mention of many manſions, and great preparations, is for the ſetting off the excellency of heaven, and for the raiſing up our expectations.</p>

To dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:31415:172"/>the hedges is in the Scripture put for a mean kind of living, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.23. and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the general acception of the phraſe, to abide by the high-ways and hedges is put for a wandring kind of life, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.46.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> That God ſends the meſſengers of the Goſpel to them, who are as vagabonds and out-caſts upon the face of the earth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.9.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and all by nature are as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds and out-caſts.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. They are ſuch as lead an unwarrantable life, as may thus appear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They move not from any good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; there is no true underſtanding with them, no fear of God before them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.11, 18. Hence the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were ſo ſottiſh, as to account the very ſtones in the high-ways as Gods, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 17.2. They anointed ſtones, their bonds and marks of Territories, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as ſacred trivial ſtatues. <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> in his ſacred ſuperſtiſion, remembers (for a part) the pouring of oil upon anointed ſtones, or ſtatues in the high-ways: whereupon <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis unguine delilutus,</hi> is reckoned by the <hi>Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leius</hi> among his ſacred objects.

Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds are lawleſs creatures, they will ſubmit to no order. Men naturally live contrary to the Law of God: they love to lurk in the high-ways, and by the hedges, without the precinct of good diſcipline.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They tend not to a good end. Men by nature are <hi>altogether become unprofitable,</hi> Rom. 3.12. like vagabonds, neither minding the common-wealth, nor their own families, for the good of which they ought to live.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. They are ſuch as lead a miſerable life, as may thus appear.</p>

Men that wander up and down in high-ways are not priviledged like thoſe who have their ſetled abode in Towns and Cities. Natural men have no acquaintance with God, nor admittance into his preſence, they live beyond the line of communication, as to fellowſhip with the Saints.</item>
                     <item>2. Vagabonds are deſtitute of houſe and home, void of neceſſary accommodations for a comfortable paſſage through this world.
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:31415:173"/>Natural men are in no houſe as it were, they live without the pale of the Church, that Church that ſhall be ſaved. As they have no enjoyment of communion with God now, ſo neither have they any hope to enjoy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him hereafter, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. while they are void of grace, they are without hope.</item>
                     <item>3. They are expoſed to wind and weather, liable to continual danger. Thoſe who are in the high-ways are in the open air, where ſtorms and tempeſts do ariſe. Thoſe that lie in the hedges may ſoon catch their death by colds and ſurfets. Thus natural men are in perpetual danger, caſt out into the wide world, walking according to the Prince of the power of the air, and according to the courſe of this world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2.

What though we be caſt out of houſe and home, and loſe all for the Goſpel, yet if we help fill heaven when we are gone from hence, will not that make amends? <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. what if we ſhould live in a world filled with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and oppreſſion, as the old world was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.13. yet God hath an Ark for <hi>Noah,</hi> an heaven for Saints; what, though we ſhould be filled with ſcorn and contempt as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.3, 4. yet there is exceeding joy in the preſence of God, <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Though heaven ſhall be filled with inhabitants, yet it ſhall be without any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance to thoſe inhabitants. We muſt not conceive that houſe above, where Saints im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately attend God's ſervice, like theſe houſes below, where we attend upon God in the uſe of means. Hear, when an houſe is filled, people are crowded; they ſtand and ſit in Little Eaſe; ſo that the very attendance upon means for the ſoul, is not without ſome annoyance to the body: but it ſhall not be ſo in heaven. That houſe is not an houſe made
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:31415:183"/>with hands, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. but eternal in the heavens, it is of an everlaſting continuance, and of a very vaſt circumference, without the leaſt inconvenience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Let us live as thoſe upon earth, who ſhall help fill heaven hereafter, let us be cleanſing our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, and ſo be perfecting holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon earth, which is the ready way to perfection of holineſs in heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. This is like w ping the feet before we enter a room kept clean and fair. No unclean thing muſt enter heaven, as full as it will be. <hi>Without are dogs,</hi> Rev. 22.15. the fitteſt place for them! what ſhould they do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? Men that live like dogs here, muſt fare like dogs hereafter: heaven is no kennel for dogs, but a Palace for Kings, for Saints, who are Kings and Prieſts unto God. Let us look to be filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs; to be filled with ſuch fruits here, is to be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for glory hereafter. Grace (like Grapes) grows by cluſters. A cluſter of theſe grapes of <hi>Canaan</hi> we may view, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. and we muſt look to be filled with ſuch fruits now, if we would have heaven filled with us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; it is called <hi>the fruit of the spirit,</hi> ſuch fruit as doth not grow in Natures Garden.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:31415:183"/>1. <hi>Love,</hi>] the bond of perfectneſs. As the Curtains of the Tabernacle were joyned by loops, ſo are all true Chriſtians by love. 2. <hi>Joy,</hi>] that in ſpecial, whereby we rejoyce in our Neighbours good. 3. <hi>Peace,</hi>] the peace of concord with our brethren. 4. <hi>Long-ſuffering,</hi>] patience drawn out at length, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing as long as the trouble. 5. <hi>Gentleneſs,</hi>] amiableneſs and ſweetneſs in behaviour. 6. <hi>Goodneſs,</hi>] uſefulneſs in our places. 7. <hi>Faith,</hi>] taken here for fidelity. 8. <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>] not eaſily provoked, a readineſs to paſs by injuries. 9. <hi>Temperance,</hi>] whereby a Chriſtian (as Maſter in his own houſe) doth ſo order his affections, that they do not ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly move, nor inordinately laſh out.</p>
                  <p>To make us now to mind the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, conſider what lyeth in our Text: the goodly company we ſhall enjoy in heaven. It was the ſpeech of good old <hi>Grynaeus,</hi>

                  <p>THis verſe containeth the concluſion of the Parable, the definitive ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon the whole. In which we have. 1. A Preface. 2. A Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Preface is a form of ſpeech uſually prefixed to raiſe our attention unto the weighty matter ſpoken of. And this very phraſe <hi>[I ſay unto you]</hi> is uſed near an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times by our Saviour in the four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts: The Prophets prefaced their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi>] But our Saviour prefaceth his Doctrine with, <hi>I ſay unto you.</hi>] The Prophets were but men, ſpeaking in the name of the Lord, but Chriſt is God as well as man, and therefore could
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:31415:185"/>ſpeak in his own name, as well as in his father's name, becauſe his father and he are one. Here the conſideration of him that ſpeaks, is ſufficient to make us receive what is ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> The Authority of the ſpeaker is ſufficient ground for the truth, and our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the holy Scripture. The Authority of the ſpeaker in ſacred Scripture is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divine, it being the word of God, and ſo the Authority of the only Deity.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>How doth it appear that thoſe writings (which we call the ſacred Scripture) is the very word of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. It is evident ſo to be, if ye look at the Pen men of Scripture, and their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial proceedings in their writings, ſetting down their own commendations, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations in expreſs terms, as <hi>Moſes</hi> doth his meekneſs at one time, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking God at another time. Now, as it is a baſe thing for a man to commend himſelf, ſo it is a fooliſh thing for a man to blaze his own faults. It appears therefore the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Scripture were not led by humane policy, but by divine Authority. And hereby it is evident, they were moved by the Holy
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:31415:185"/>Ghoſt to ſet down what they did, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. As for that objection which ſome make from the circumſtantial different expreſſions of the Pen-men, writing the ſame things as the four Evangeliſts: we may retort the objection, ſeeing the difference is not ſubſtantial, but circumſtantial, and thence fetch a good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove the divine authority of the Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Pen-men did not lay their Heads together about the framing of their writings, and did not tranſcribe one anothers Copies, they agreeing in the main, and yet differing in things of a leſſer conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is admirable to conſider of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we look at the matter of theſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, it is evident, it comes from heaven, becauſe it tends to heaven, directing men thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and taking them off from the world. There is not one tittle of it that ſavours of earthlyneſs, or tends to the maintaining of carnal intereſt; ſo then as the light of the Sun ſheweth it ſelf to be the Sun, as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of a learned man proves himſelf to be learned; ſo the language of the Scripture evidenceth it to be ſacred, it breathing forth nothing but godlineſs, thereby it appeareth to be the very breath of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we look at the effects of theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:31415:186"/>what a wonderful force they have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the inſides of men. <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> that thoſe places among the <hi>Brittains,</hi> which the <hi>Romans</hi> could never come at, were ſubdued by Chriſt, that is, by his word. Here we may appeal to mens conſciences for evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The awakened conſcience of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man trembleth at this word. The clear conſcience of an holy man feels a through change within made by force of this word. I can ſpeak it by experience, ſaith <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> that there is little good to be gotten by the Goſpel, if a man read it curſorily and careleſly, but if he exerciſe himſelf therein conſtantly and conſcionably, he ſhall feel ſuch a force in it, as is not to be found again in any other book whatſoever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If we conſider the preſervation of theſe Scriptures. That writings penned by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeveral men, at ſo many ſeveral places, in ſo many ſeveral ages, ſhould be kept ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire together, is more than humane power to bring it to paſs.</p>

Study the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of God's Authority. This made the Centurion believe Chriſt upon his bare word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.8, 9. And be acquainted with thoſe Experiments that aſſure you that God is as good as his word, Such as that of God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> juſt at the time appointed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.41. God kept his word to a day.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Herein is the high commendation of faith, when we can thus believe God on his bare word. This made Chriſt ſay of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion's faith, he had not found ſo great faith, no not in <hi>Iſrael, Matth.</hi> 8.10. he admired it, as incomparable and matchleſs. Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Chriſt to come to them; others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Chriſt to touch them, but the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion required no more than this, that Chriſt ſhould only ſpeak the word.</item>
                     <item>2. Do ye not truſt many a man upon his bare word, whom you look upon as a man of credit? and ſhall we not much more believe
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:31415:188"/>God becauſe of his Authority ſpeaking to us, though we ſee not a reaſon of ſuch and ſuch things?</item>
                     <item>3.

Such as theſe truſt God no farther, than they can ſee cauſe or reaſon to yield unto him. How ſhall we know a Chriſtian from another man, but by adding faith to his reaſon, and that about the things here below? Thoſe of <hi>China</hi> ſay, that they only ſee with two eyes; and the reſt of the world but with one: it is moſt true of real Chriſtians, they only ſee with two eyes; the eye of reaſon, and the eye of faith, and the reſt of the world with reaſon only.</item>

                  <p n="1">1. They have no ſound knowledge, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual diſcerning of divine truth.

                  <p n="4">4. They have no meditation on God and his word. They chew not the promiſes, nor turn them into fatneſs, they feed not upon ſuch dainties.
